# Stock-Prediction
 This code is a Python script that creates a Streamlit web application for stock price prediction. It allows users to select a company (Google, Apple, Microsoft, or GameStop), choose the number of years for stock price forecasting, and view both raw stock data and forecasted stock prices. The app leverages data from Yahoo Finance, uses the Prophet library for time series forecasting, and Plotly for data visualization. Additionally, it provides information about the selected company and includes user instructions for navigating the app. The code offers an interactive and informative tool for exploring and predicting stock prices for different companies.
